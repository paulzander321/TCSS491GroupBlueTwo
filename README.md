TCSS 491 - Blue Two
==========================
Things to do:
-----------------------
* Fix scrolling when near edges - player should move instead of scroll.
* Add some dumb enemies and maybe a smarter enemy type. 
* Create new map with no up/down scrolling.
* Add platforms corresponding to new map. Maybe moving platforms??
* Also add spikes and pits for new map. 
* **Fix wall collisions** - Player should not be able to walk through the side of platforms.
* Completely redo shooting logic to enable recharge when not shooting. Maybe add charge as well?
* Add logic for collisions with enemies and death logic for enemies.
