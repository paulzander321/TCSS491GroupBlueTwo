TCSS 491 - Blue Two
==========================
Things to do:
-----------------------
* Make scrolling start again only when player's x coordinate is middle of screen.
*   -We have bug when he isnt dead center or shifts the screen locks again. 
* Add some dumb enemies and maybe a smarter enemy type. 
* **Fix wall collisions** - Player should not be able to walk through the side of platforms.
* Add logic for collisions with enemies and death logic for enemies. 

DONE: 
------------------------
* Create new map with no up/down scrolling.
* Fix scrolling when near edges - player now moves when near edge.
* Added basic platforms for the new map.s
* Add in platforms for the ceiling so Megaman can't jump above ceiling.
* Also add spikes and pits for new map (including logic for damage/death/temporary invincibibility and maybe launch when hitting spikes)
* Change the shooting code to set one delay instead of ongoing interval for shooting cooldown.
